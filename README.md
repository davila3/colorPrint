# colorPrint
Simple python package for using escape codes for printing with colors on terminals.


To use you your project I recomend either copying the colorPrint folder and placing the Package in your project or use this command `python -m pip install git+https://github.com/davila3/colorPrint.git#egg=colorPrint`.

```
from colorPrint import *

pred('this should print this string with a red foreground')
print(red("this'll be red"), blue("this'll be blue"))

demo() # this'll print a demo

```
